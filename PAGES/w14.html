                    Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen upon Tanjirou
                    Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to
                    enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local
                    village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to
                    take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons
                    that lurk in the woods at night. When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a
                    horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister
                    Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears
                    to avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling
                    themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect
                    the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.
