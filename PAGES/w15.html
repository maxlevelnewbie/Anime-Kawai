                    Tokyo is currently experiencing rain showers that seem to disrupt the usual pace of everyone living
                    there to no end. Amidst this seemingly eternal downpour arrives the runaway high school student
                    Hodaka Morishima, who struggles to financially support himself—ending up with a job at a small-time
                    publisher. At the same time, the orphaned Hina Amano also strives to find work to sustain herself
                    and her younger brother. Both fates intertwine when Hodaka attempts to rescue Hina from shady men,
                    deciding to run away together. Subsequently, Hodaka discovers that Hina has a strange yet astounding

                    girl"—someone who will clear the sky for people when they need it the most. Things begin looking up
                    for them at first. However, it is common knowledge that power always comes with a hefty price...
