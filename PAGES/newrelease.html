                            <p class="newrelease-description">
                                The qualities valued most in the study of magic are bloodline, aptitude, and effort. There was one sorcerer who, despite his deep love for magic, was born a commoner and thus lacked the bloodline and aptitude for it. As he died an unnatural death, he wished he had studied magic more while he had the chance. Then, he was reincarnated as Lloyd, the seventh prince of the Kingdom of Saloum and one blessed with a strong magical bloodline.

Meanwhile, Senkuu and some of his teammates rush toward the Amazon in South America—the epicenter of the petrification beam's impact—to create Superalloy City and progress their spaceship project.
