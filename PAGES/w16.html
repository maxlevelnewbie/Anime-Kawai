                    As a wild youth, elementary school student Shouya Ishida sought to beat boredom in the cruelest
                    ways. When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class
                    thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and
                    blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of the school, Shouya is left at the
                    mercy of his classmates. He is heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school,
                    while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by
                    his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of
                    redemption: to meet Shouko once more and make amends. Koe no Katachi tells the heartwarming tale of
                    Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually
                    haunted by the shadows of his past
